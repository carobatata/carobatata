### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Carolina Acosta, a full stack developer, but it wasn't always like that. I am a Lawyer as well and I worked as a legal counsel in Tech companies such as Accenture and Wolox (an argentine start up).

Working in tech companies introduced me to this wonderful IT world. I was amazed by the work environment and the innovative and creative atmosphere so I started to feel very curious about this new and unlimited world.

Recently I relocated to Barcelona and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to reinvent myself and take a step forward in my career. I decided to go big and study programming.

ðŸ’» My stack:
Programming language: JavaScript.
Front End: React, Redux, HTML5, CSS.
Back End: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
Database: PostgreSQL.
ORM: Sequelize.
Tools: Trello, Slack.
Methodologies: SCRUM.
Version Control: GIT & GitHub.

Feel free to email or DM me, I'll be happy to hear from you.
