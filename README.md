### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Carolina Acosta, a full stack developer, but it wasn't always like that. I am a Lawyer as well and I worked as a legal counsel in Tech companies such as Accenture and Wolox (an argentine start up).

Working in tech companies introduced me to this wonderful IT world. I was amazed by the work environment and the innovative and creative atmosphere so I started to feel very curious about this new and unlimited world.

Recently I relocated to Barcelona and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to explore this tech side and thatâ€™s why I started to study software development. Iâ€™m really excited about the possibility of mixing my previous and newly acquired skills.

ðŸ’» Technologies:
Programming language: JavaScript.
Front End: React, Redux, HTML5, CSS.
Back End: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
Database: PostgreSQL.
ORM: Sequelize.
Tools: Trello, Slack.
Methodologies: SCRUM.
Version Control: GIT & GitHub.
